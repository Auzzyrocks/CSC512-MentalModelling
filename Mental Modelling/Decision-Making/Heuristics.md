# Definition
The word heuristic comes from the Greek verb "heurísko", which means to discover, or find out. Then, the branch of heuristics is related to investigation, and learning. Generally, heuristics are considered to be a rule or piece of information that is used to solve a problem, or help with making a decision. Traditionally, heuristics that pertain to human problem-solving are considered to be applied unconsciously and automatically. Heuristics are fast and cognitively-efficient, but are also prone to the creation of potential errors. As an example from Tversky & Kahneman (1974), humans use the clarity of a presented object to determine its apparent distance from oneself. This can be an effective heuristic, as typically objects more distant from oneself are less clear to the human eye. However, when visibility is impacted (either reduced or increased), humans worsen at their judgements of apparent distance. It is to be noted that without this heuristic, the speed at which one could make judgements of apparent distance would significantly decrease, but in exchange one would improve at making these judgements under alternative conditions. 

[[Descriptive Decision-Making Models|Descriptive decision-making models]] aim to explain how people actually make decisions, as opposed to how they should make decisions, as represented by [[Normative Decision-Making Models|normative decision-making models]]. These models acknowledge that humans are [[Descriptive Decision-Making Models#Bounded Rationality|boundedly rational]], as their reasoning is limited due to time, cognitive capacity, available information, and [[Limitations and Biases of Mental Models|biases]]. Descriptive models like [[Descriptive Decision-Making Models#Prospect Theory|Prospect Theory]] (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) directly incorporate heuristics into their framework, explaining systematic deviations from expected utility. Heuristics provide micro-level cognitive mechanisms that descriptive models are then able to formalize at the macro-level. 
# Key Heuristics
### Availability Heuristic
The tendency to estimate the likelihood or frequency of an event based on how easily instances or examples come to mind (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973). People often overestimate dramatic but memorable events (higher salience), often due to increased media coverage.
### Anchoring & Adjustment Heuristic
Individuals tend to rely heavily on initial information, or an anchor, when making numerical estimates or judgements (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973). This heuristic is often utilized during monetary negotiations, where the seller will suggest an initial price which negotiations will anchor around, making subsequent lower prices seem like a better deal than they may truly be.
### Representativeness Heuristic
A judgement of categorical belonging based on an established prototype. As an example, one might assume that a person works as a lawyer or businessperson due to them wearing a suit. 
### Recognition Heuristic
When one is faced with two options, if one is recognized and one not, the recognized one has higher perceived value (Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996). If a person is asked which city has a larger population, Vancouver or Kinshasa, a person unfamiliar with Kinshasa (which is in the Democratic Republic of Congo) might say Vancouver, when Kinshasa has a population of over 17 million. 
### Affect Heuristic
This heuristic states that decision-making is often influenced by immediate emotional responses, rather than by deliberate analysis (Slovic et al., 2002). As an example, one might judge nuclear energy as a risky and non-beneficial venture simply because of the negative connotations associated with the word "nuclear".
