An example of decision making in driving, applying information from [[Decision-Making, Mental Modelling, and Cognitive Augmentation Hub]].

## Mechanism

Driving is an example of [[Descriptive Decision-Making Models#Bounded Rationality|bounded rationality]]. Most drive with some limitation on attention, working memory, and time. Making it impossible to perform optimal calculations for every maneuver that may be required while driving. Instead [[Descriptive Decision-Making Models#Dual-Process Theory|Dual Process Theory]]  describes how decision making in driving are made.

1. **Intuitive System:** Handles routine operations such as lane keeping/changing, or tasks that require quick response.
2. **Analytical System:** Handles more complex operations that requires more time to navigate, such as complex intersections.

These two cognitive systems allow drivers to **satisfice**, rather than optimize.

## [[Schema Theory|Schemas]]

Drivers can also store certain actions as part of driving schema.

A driving schema can contain simple driving tasks such as:
- braking 
- accelerating
- steering

It could also contain more complex tasks such as:
- lane swapping
- merging
- parallel parking
