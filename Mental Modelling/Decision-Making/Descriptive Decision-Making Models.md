# Definition
Descriptive decision-making models aim to provide an explanation for how people actually make decisions, factoring their [[Limitations and Biases Hub||biases]] and [[Heuristics|heuristics]] rather than posing an assumption of perfect rationality and consistency. Descriptive models incorporate findings from the fields of psychology, behavioural economics, and cognitive science to recognize that human reasoning is [[Descriptive Decision-Making Models#Bounded Rationality|bounded]] by limitations in information, cognitive capacity, and time (Simon, 1955).
# Key Ideas
## Bounded Rationality
Bounded rationality posits that people aim for *satisficing* rather than *optimizing* (Simon, 1955). Decision-making agents will seek a solution that can be deemed as "good enough" rather than the most optimal solution, as they are constrained on information, cognitive resources, and time. As such, individuals will rely on heuristics or simplifying strategies, as opposed to maximizing expected utility, as would an agent relying on [[Normative Decision-Making Models]]. Bounded rationality suggests that human reasoning is *ecologically rational*, meaning that reasoning is rational within real environments (Simon, 1955). As an example, a person choosing a job will not compare every single possible employer, and will instead stop when they have found a job that meets their requirements. Human "irrational" behaviour is often an adaptive response to cognitive limitations. 
## Prospect Theory
Prospect Theory is a descriptive alternative to [[Normative Decision-Making Models#Expected Utility Theory|Expected Utility Theory]], developed by Kahneman and Tversky (1979). Rather than focusing on absolute outcomes, it highlights how people evaluate gains and losses relative to a certain reference point. Kahneman and Tversky (1979) defined a few key points as follows:
- **Loss Aversion**: losses feel more impactful than a gain of the same amount.
- **Diminishing Sensitivity**: the subjective difference between $100 and $200 feels much greater than $1,100 and $1,200.
- **Probability Weighting**: people overweight small probabilities and underweight large ones.
Prospect Theory helps to explain phenomena like risk aversion in gains, and risk seeking in losses. 
## Naturalistic Decision Making
Naturalistic Decision Making (NDM) focuses on how experts approach making fast, high-stakes decisions in real world environments, and was developed by Gary Klein and colleagues (1993). NDM emphasizes decisions made with a lack of deliberation, such as those often made by firefighters, nurses, or pilots.
- **Pattern Recognition**: experts are able to identify familiar cues and situations rapidly.
- **Mental Simulation**: experts can mentally project possible outcomes for situations before they happen.
- **Experience-Based Intuition**: past experiences shape and enhance immediate judgements.
The Recognition-Primed Decision model, which is an important part of NDM, suggests that people rarely compare multiple options, instead recognizing a pattern, generate an action response, and then test that response mentally to investigate its feasibility (Klein, 1998).
## Dual-Process Theory
This framework proposed by Kahneman (2011) as well as Stanovich and West (2000) distinguishes between two parallel, interacting cognitive systems: 
1) A fast, automatic, and intuitive system which relies primarily on [[Heuristics]].
2) A slow, effortful, and analytical system that relies on logical reasoning.
Kahneman (2011) proposes that descriptive decision-making relies on frequent interplay between these systems, as System 1. is cognitively efficient but often biased, whereas System 2. is typically correct but slow and cognitively inefficient. 
# Applications
The following represent a small subset of possible applications for Descriptive Decision-Making Models, with the intention being to emphasize their broad scope of use cases. 
## Everyday Decision-Making
Generally, Descriptive Models help to explain why people frequently rely on mental shortcuts as opposed to rational, objective calculations. As an example, one may choose between two varying brands with equal rational weight simply due to their [[Heuristics#Recognition Heuristic|Recognition Heuristic]], as they have seen more advertising for one brand than another. This impact on their decision-making may not even be conscious to them, and it is important to realize how much we rely on our [[Heuristics]], and what this means for the decisions we make.
## Business and Financial Decisions
[[Heuristics]] and Descriptive Models are very relevant in business and financial settings. As an example, the [[Heuristics#Anchoring & Adjustment Heuristic|Anchoring Heuristic]] is particularly relevant in price negotiations or estimations, marketing, financial projections, and salary negotiations. [[Descriptive Decision-Making Models#Prospect Theory|Loss Aversion]] can influence investment behaviour, and as a result the market as a whole. 
## Artificial Intelligence
Understanding the way that humans think is an extremely important aspect when one is designing systems intended to augment humans. Cognitive architectures such as ACT-R and Soar model human cognitive constraints explicitly, which allow for them to simulate realistic decision-making processes (Laird, 2022). Utilizing descriptive principles can emulate intuitive judgement and adapt under limited information, which can improve interpretability and trust. In [[Descriptive Decision-Making Models#Naturalistic Decision Making|Naturalistic Decision-Making]] frameworks, AI models for emergency response or military decision support systems incorporate contextual and experience-based heuristics, rather than assuming perfect rationality (Bosch & Bronkhorst, 2018).
