When users are interacting with a system they are using pre-existing mental models built on similar systems and their knowledge of how those systems behave. If the system behaves how they predict it will, than navigating it will feel intuitive but if it does not mimic previous systems then it can feel difficult to use and require more mental effort to use. 

User interface mental models are built by multiple factors: Cultural Usability

A system needs to align with the users interaction logic, visual hierarchy, language and symbols 
Interaction Logic
This is how the user moves between screens and complete actions. It should mirror how the user mentally structure tasks and decision making. It is the idea of cause and effect, if a system aligns with a users mental model then when they will correctly predict the outcome of an action. "If I click this button it will take me to the expected page I am looking to get to". It allows the user to navigate the system without needing instruction on how to operate and control.  An example of this is when you click the "trash" button you expect your work to be removed and deposited into a trash folder where you can later undo the move if desired. If the system moves something to trash and does not allow the user to undo if needed this could go against the users mental model of how the systems interface works and can cause errors. 

Components of interaction Logic 
- Task flow logic 
		order in which user expects to preform actions
- Feedback logic 
		How system communicates results 
- navigation 
		Movement between screens
- Control 
		sense of agency over system 
- Error and recovery logic 
		recovery paths when something goes wrong 

**Visual Hierarchy**
Visual Hierarchy is important within user interface as it highlights how users will scan a page and what elements they focus on first and how much information they expect upfront. An example of this is where the user expects to find the menu or return to the home page should be executed by clicking the logo. If these typical functions are not laid out in a way they expect than they will have to relearn the system and create a mental model specifically for this system which can mean it is frustrating to use or to hard to use where they might chose to not use the program.
