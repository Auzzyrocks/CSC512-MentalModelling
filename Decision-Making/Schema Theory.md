# Background

Schema theory is an area of cognitive science that studies how the brain organizes and structures knowledge. Schemas are units of knowledge. These schemas can be called upon following formation in order to advise processing during later events that occur to a person. Events that do not align with one's created schemas are often met with confusion, as the person does not have previous experience with events related to the scenario they are in to inform their decisions. Schema theory emerged in the 1970s-80s as part of the cognitive revolution, extending Bartlett's (1932) ideas on memory and Piaget's (1926/1952) work on adaptation, and introduction of schemas as cognitive structures that develop through assimilation and accommodation. Rumelhart's formalization (discussed below) connected these ideas with computational models of knowledge representation, anticipating later work in connectionism and cognitive architectures.

# Schemata
Schemas do not simply represent lists of facts; rather, they are a structured network of concepts, and how they relate. As a simple example, a "gym schema" would include the actions of entering, gaining access (perhaps via an access card or app), changing, and exercising (which would vary depending on a person's differing routine - perhaps cardio into arms). If someone says that they went to the gym, a schema would allow one to infer steps that occurred there without them being explicitly mentioned. Schemas are flexible, and can update to include new experiences when they are encountered. This may represent a change to the average, like a new typical gym routine, or a more dramatic shift. Schemas are hierarchical and composable, with more abstract schemas being a composition of less abstract schemas. Schemas are similar to [[Heuristics]] in that they can represent mental shortcuts. 

According to Rumelhart and Norman (1978), schemas develop via three formal processes: accretion, tuning, and restructuring:

1) **Accretion**: as a person experiences events throughout their day-to-day lives, new concepts and features are added to existing schema. This does not impact the overall organization of schemas, and simply expands upon existing ones.
2) **Tuning**: existing schema that currently exist are modified so as to align with events and experiences a person undergoes, which can remove features.
3) **Restructuring**: a new schema develops to encompass newly-learned information, and current knowledge reorganizes. This process involves the most overall change. 

# Imagery and Schemata
When learning new information, individuals often construct and utilize mental images of situations. As schemata consist of how knowledge is organized concerning events and situations, this mental imagery helps to activate and manipulate schemata. With respect to learning, rich, contextually-relevant visuals can help a learner to create a vivid mental scenario which forms strong linkages within their created schemata. Imagery in this regard functions as a form of external scaffold for the formation of schemata, and by proxy internally-represented mental models - an externalization of an internal simulation that allows the learner to more directly test and adjust their established schemata for more effective learning.
# Schemas and Mental Models
Schemas are, in many ways, pre-existing mental models that we use to predict and understand events. They guide our attention, the encoding of memory,
