Visual Hierarchy is important within user interface as it highlights how users will scan a page and what elements they focus on first and how much information they expect upfront. Effective visual hierarchy leverages human perceptual and cognitive patterns to guide attention in predictable ways (Ware, 2013). If these typical functions are not laid out in a way they expect than they will have to relearn the system and create a mental model specifically for this system which can mean it is frustrating to use or to hard to use where they might chose to not use the program. This mismatch between expectation and design often leads to abandonment or negative user experience (Norman, 1988).

### Design techniques
#### Size and scale
Larger items seem more important, they are often where users will focus their attention first. Users’ visual scanning patterns naturally prioritize large or prominent shapes due to innate perceptual hierarchies (Ware, 2013).

#### Color and contrast
Bright colors will draw a users attention while muted ones won't pop as much. Highlighting important information or using red text to signify an error are useful strategies to aid the user.
#### Spacing
Helps the brain chunk information into meaningful sections, allowing the user to skim through sections when looking for specific sections. It improves clarity and readability within the system making it easier to navigate. This organization makes it easier for users to skim, locate, and interpret content efficiently (Tullis & Albert, 2013).
#### Text
Different headings, subheading, and body text allow for a system way to organize topics within different areas. Again simplifying what the topic will be about before the user needs to read through and figure out what the topic is about. 

#### Alignment
Predictable placement is helpful for ease of use as it reduces search time. Keeping navigation menus consistently aligned to the left or the top gives the user peace of mind always knowing where something is. Keeping menus consistently aligned at the top or left supports intuitive navigation and promotes ease of use (Norman, 1988).

#### Animation
Engages the user and draws immediate attention. Too much animation can be distracting and cause the user to loose track of what they were doing. When used sparingly only for important pop ups it can allow effective communication between the system and the user. Simple animations such as a hover effect to show interactivity while not being distracting.
