# Contrast
Normative models describe how people should make decisions given that they were to be fully informed, rational, and entirely consistent. Descriptive models describe the ways in which people actually make real world decisions, factoring cognitive biases, heuristics, and limitations. 
### Pros of Normative Models
- Provides a grounded benchmark for optimality under perfect conditions.
- Can provide a basis for identifying errors or biases in human decision-making.
- Mathematically rigorous.
- Universally applicable across many domains.
- Under ideal conditions, can be predictive.
### Cons of Normative Models
- Can lead to unrealistic assumptions - requires complete information, consistency, and unlimited cognitive capacity.
- Does not account for emotions, biases, or [[Heuristics|heuristics]].
- Not as adaptive to changing environments (though [[Normative Decision-Making Models#Bayesian Decision Making Models|Bayesian Decision Making Models]] allow for some adaptation).
- Can be difficult to communicate due to dense probabilistic and mathematical background.
### Pros of Descriptive Models
- Reflective of real behaviour, encapsulating [[Heuristics|heuristics]], [[Limitations and Biases of Mental Models|biases]], bounded rationality.
- Sensitive to context and adaptation.
- Integrates psychological insights such as cognitive load, intuitive vs. analytical thinking.
- Better explains systematic deviations from optimality.
### Cons of Descriptive Models
- Less prescriptive, does not provide an *ideal* solution.
- Can be fragmented and hard to generalize.
- Less precise.
- Can reinforce existing biases.

| Normative   | Benchmark for optimal solution; basis for errors, mathematical rigour; universal application; predictive in ideal state. | Unrealistic assumptions; limited account for human factor; less adaptive to varying contexts; difficult to communicate. |
| Descriptive | Reflects real behaviour; sensitive to context; integrates psychological insights; explains deviations from optimality.   | Less prescriptive; can be fragmented; less precise; can reinforce biases.                                               |
