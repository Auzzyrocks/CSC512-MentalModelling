## Driving as a Cognitive Task

Despite being one of the most common activities, driving is a complex cognitive task that demands the use of multiple facets of cognition continuously. From lower cognitive tasks such as perception or attention to higher tasks such as prediction and decision-making. The key to managing the continuous stream of complex tasks lies in drivers' mental model.  The vehicle,  the environment, and the traffic systems are all internally represented to help drivers navigate through the dynamic process. Specifically, it helps drivers understand two very critical aspects: the vehicles’ capabilities and limitations, and the current and the possible states of the environment around them.  

## Formation

Drivers' mental model is built through multiple channels:

**Direct Experience**: 
- Driving on the road
	- Through practice, cause and effect are learned and reflected internally.

**Indirect Experience**:
- Using driving simulations or games.
- Watching training videos
- Reading manuals
	- Reading manuals to understand basic mechanics of the vehicle

**Interactive Feedback**:
- Information processed from sounds, haptic feedback from steering wheels etc.

However, these sources alone do not automatically calibrate the model (Nasser, 2025). Drivers with extensive experience can still misjudge vehicle capabilities or system limitations.

Calibration can occur through:

- Repeated exposure to edge cases and unexpected situations while driving
- Explicit outcomes from driving decisions that provide correct feedbacks
- Extensive learning of system functions 


## [[Limitations and Biases Hub|Limitations and Biases]]
**Bias in time: Time saving bias**

Drivers *overestimate* the time saved when increasing speed from a high level, and *underestimate* the time saved when increasing speed from a low level (Svenson, 2017). For example: increasing speed from 90 km/h to 100 km/h may be seen as greater increase in speed than increasing the speed from 30 km/h to 50 km/h. Higher speeds receive too much weight and lower speed too little weight in drivers' mental model, compared to objective reality. 

**Workaround:**
Study (Svenson, 2017) found switching speedometer display from km-per-hour to minutes-per-kilometer greatly reduced time saving bias.
