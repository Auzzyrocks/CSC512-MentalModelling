*"All models are wrong, but some are useful"* -  George E. P. Box, Statistician

# Biases
Many biases in mental modeling, and decision making more broadly, exist. These are a tendency for human reasoning to fail to meet logical or probabilistic standards, and are caused by a variety of reasons. Below are only a selection of existing well-known biases.

## Belief Bias
Several specific types of bias have been commonly observed in mental models and the broader category of decision making. As explained below by Torrens (1999) there exists a belief bias, such that people are more willing to accept a mental model that produces an outcome that aligns with their belief system as opposed to their beliefs. Torres (1999) notes that this bias also applies to  believable outcomes, which are more readily accepted, as opposed to a model that produces a less-believable outcome which may actually be the correct outcome. 

*According to mental models theory, the effect of beliefs is to pre-empt the  
search for alternative models. If the first model of the premises yields a  
believable conclusion, then the search for further models may be terminated.  
However, if the first conclusion is unbelievable, then the search for alternatives  
may be continued and a different conclusion reached. In this manner, people  
accept more believable than unbelievable conclusions, even when those  
conclusions are not necessarily valid* (Torrens, 1999).

## Conjunction Fallacy 
Similar to many other biases, conjunction fallacy results from an inability to correctly evaluate the probability of an event. The conjunction fallacy specifically refers to the conjunction of two events and the probabilistic limitations. Specifically, given events A and B, the probability of event AB can never be greater than the probability of event A alone. However, mental models often fail to accept this, as explained below by Gigerenzer (1993) in an elegant example known as the Linda Problem: 

*Imagine you are a subject in a psychological experiment. In front of you is a text problem, and you begin to read:

*Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in antinuclear demonstrations. Which of two alternatives is more probable?  
	(a) Linda is a bank teller.  
	(b) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.*

*Which alternative would you choose? Assume you chose (b), just as most subjects in previous experiments did. The experimenter explains to you that (b) is the conjunction of two events, namely that Linda is a bank teller **and** is active in the feminist movement, whereas (a) is one of the constituents of the conjunction. Because the probability of a conjunction of two events cannot be greater than that of one of its constituents, the correct answer is (a), not (b), the experimenter says. Therefore, your judgment is recorded as an instance of a reasoning error, known as the **conjunction fallacy*** (Gigerenzer, 1993).
