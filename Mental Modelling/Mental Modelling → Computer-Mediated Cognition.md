### **Concept**

In cognitive science, **mental modelling** refers to the internal representations that people construct to simulate systems, predict outcomes, and reason about problems.  
When translated into computational contexts, computers become **external supports for mental modelling**—they visualize, test, and synchronize users’ mental representations.  
This mapping turns digital tools into _cognitive partners_ that extend human reasoning capacity.

### **How Computers Operationalize Mental Modelling for Cognitive Augmentation**

Computers operationalize mental modelling by transforming abstract internal reasoning into observable, manipulable, and shareable forms. Through **visual interfaces and simulation models**, internal thought processes become external representations that users can inspect, modify, and refine. This externalization helps individuals clarify their understanding of complex systems and improve the accuracy of their mental models.

In collaborative environments, **computer-supported cooperative work systems** play a crucial role in aligning the mental models of different participants. By providing shared digital spaces for interaction and visualization, these systems reduce misunderstanding and foster collective cognition.

Computers also promote **metacognitive development** by offering real-time feedback. In intelligent tutoring systems or interactive learning platforms, users can see how their assumptions deviate from system responses, prompting reflection and restructuring of their conceptual frameworks.

Finally, **simulation and decision-support tools** extend mental modelling into predictive reasoning. By allowing users to explore hypothetical scenarios, test variables, and visualize outcomes, these systems expand human capacity for anticipating consequences and reasoning under uncertainty.

Together, these computational implementations show how digital technologies act as partners in cognition—externalizing and enhancing the mental modelling processes that underlie learning, collaboration, and decision-making.

### **llustrative Examples from _Computers, Communication, and Mental Models (2017)_**

 **Computer-Based Instruction Systems** – transform abstract concepts into interactive visualizations that help learners form stable and accurate mental models.
 **Group Decision-Support Environments** – externalize the reasoning of multiple users, allowing mental models to converge through shared visual and computational representations.
**Problem-Solving Simulations** – enable users to run cognitive experiments, test hypotheses, and observe system dynamics, strengthening predictive reasoning and adaptive learning.

These cases demonstrate that when computers mediate mental modelling, co[[]()]()gnition becomes **distributed** across minds and machines, yielding a measurable increase in understanding, coordination, and decision quality.

### **Synthesis**

The integration of mental modelling with computational mediation redefines cognition as a **hybrid human–computer process**.  
By externalizing mental models through visualization, simulation, and collaboration, digital systems actively **amplify the cognitive capacities** of individuals and groups—fulfilling the central goal of cognitive augmentation.
