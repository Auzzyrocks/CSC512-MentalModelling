Various tools and technologies exist to help augment the mental modeling process. Since mental models are continually evolving and/or being replaced, there is constant opportunity to improve our internal modeling process, which can lead to better decision making and understanding of our environment. Many of the tools used to address [[Biases of Mental Models|bias in mental models]] also address the [[Limitations of Mental Models|limitations of mental models]], and vice versa. As a result, these tools will be discussed together. Below some examples of cognitive augmentations tools are described and discussed.

## Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping
A Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) is a graphical approach to augmenting mental modelling and reducing mental model bias. In this approach, and system is mapped according to a direct causal influence (the arrows) between factors (the boxes). Empirical data is not necessary, but the strength of a given influence can be indicated. Two major approaches are used to creative a FCM, the casual approach, or the dynamic. The primary difference being that the edge values in the dynamic approach represent the strength of a casual influence, and the in the casual model the edge values represent the certainty of a casual influence. In both models, a positive edge value indicate that a factor causes another factor to happen, and a negative value indicates that a factor causes another factor to not happen, to some degree (Kok, 2009).

The example above is a dynamic FCM for deforestation in the Amazon rain forest. This shows the impact of various factors, such as Demand, on other factors, such as Agricultural expansion. Notice how some Factor scan influence themselves, and how some influences work in both directions.  Below is the given FCM output for the above deforestation FCM. This is generated from the FCM and shows the influence of a factor on all other factors, including those influences that are secondary or tertiary by travelling through another factor.  The top left graph shows the map as drawn above, and the other three graphs represent variations to the map above, exploring different scenarios.

## Virtual Worlds
Virtual Worlds, also called Microworlds are a broad category of simulation where a person can test their mental model. These include physical models, role-playing, and computer simulations (Sterman, 1994). The process of engaging one's mental model and testing it's accuracy through these systems forms an informational feedback loop, as shown below, enabling a person to evaluate and improve their mental models through a concentrated experience, without the possible repercussions of a real world interaction. 

Sterman (1994) highlights seven virtues of virtual worlds: 

- Low-cost learning 
- Dilation or compression of time and space
- Repeatability and variability
- Ability to pause and reflect 
- Ability to attempt dangerous, unfeasible or unethical actions
- Ability to experiment with poor or catastrophic strategies
- High-quality feedback

The value of these qualities of a virtual world is that the are not readily available in the real world. For example, a pilot in training may find that access to an aeroplane is expensive and has time-overhead (in terms of fueling, signing paperwork, etc). Furthermore, a pilot is unable to pause flying a real plane and reflect on their actions, and putting a plane into dangerous conditions to test their skills (flying through a storm, or recovering from a dive) is highly inadvisable. However, a flight simulator allows a pilot to circumvent all of these hurdles, achieving a compressed, rich experience and cost-effective experience in a controlled and safe environment.
