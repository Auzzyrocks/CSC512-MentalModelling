- **Internal representation:** the private mental structure you carry in working/long-term memory (your “mental model”).  

- **[[External Representations]]:** a persistent, manipulable structure in the world: a diagram, table, sketch, timeline, equation on a whiteboard, Python Tutor’s heap/stack view, a concept map, a node, link graph, sticky notes on a wall. In practice, people couple the external and internal representations: they read structure from the external display and write structure back to it as they think. This is the core of external/distributed cognition.

- **[[Mental Modelling/Memory Offloading]]**: using the visual display to hold intermediate states, relations, and cues so the mind doesn’t have to. This frees limited working memory to focus on pattern-finding, hypothesis testing, and explanation. This makes visual external representations far more effective.

- **[[Matching Visuals to Tasks]]**: assigning an appropriate visual for a given task. When an appropriate visual representation is chosen for the data, the task becomes easier to analyze or solve.
