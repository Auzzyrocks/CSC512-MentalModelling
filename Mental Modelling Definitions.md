# Definitions
There is no single, concise definition of a mental model. Instead, the description of, and terminology around, mental models has continually evolved. Below are some of the various definitions which all in some way contribute to an understanding of the concept. 

## The Nature of Explanation
Kenneth Craik is widely accredited with first describing mental models in his 1942 work *The Nature of Explanation*, writing that

*“If the organism carries a “small-scale model” of external reality and of its own possible actions within its head, it is able to try out various alternatives, conclude which is the best of them, react to future situations before they arise, utilise the knowledge of past events in dealing with the present and future, and in every way to react in a much fuller, safer, and more competent manner to the emergencies which face it.”*

## American Psychological Association 
*Any internal representation of the relations between a set of elements, as, for example, between workers in an office or department, the elements of a mathematics or physics problem, the terms of a syllogism, or the configuration of objects in a space. Such models may contain perceptual qualities and may be abstract in nature. They can be manipulated to provide dynamic simulations of possible scenarios and are thought to be key components in decision making. In the context of ergonomics, for example, a mental model of a system or product would include its various attributes, rules for operation and handling, and expectations regarding use and consequences and would be used to guide the individual’s interactions with the system or product in question.

## Holtrop et al.
*A mental model is a person's mental representation of the way some aspect of the world works ([17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8290163/#B17), [25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8290163/#B25), [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8290163/#B26)). More specifically, mental models are comprised of interrelated memories, conceptual knowledge, and causal beliefs that create an understanding of how something works in the real world and forms expectations about future events. For example, many, if not most, individuals in the United States (US) have a mental model of a doctor's appointment that includes the steps of the encounter, what kinds of questions and examination to expect, how to interpret what the doctor says (and does not say), and how to interact with the doctor to obtain desired information, tests, and treatments. This particular set of conceptual knowledge, expectations, and causal beliefs is formed primarily by our personal experiences and might also be formed by the transfer of cultural knowledge through media and social networks.*

## Mental Models Concepts for System Dynamics Research
In 1998 Doyle and Ford comprehensively explored existing definitions of mental models in their paper *Mental Models Concepts for System Dynamics Research*. Below are some excerpts from this paper that help elucidate their definition.

*We propose that a mental model of a dynamic system is a relatively enduring and
accessible, but limited, internal conceptual representation of an external system whose
structure maintains the perceived structure of that system.*

*The stability of mental models is difficult to describe. Parts of mental models
may be altered, deleted, or added on a time scale of minutes or seconds. Yet, a mental
model considered as a whole, while continually changing in detail, may endure in
memory in some form for years or decades*

*We believe the term "mental model" should not be used to refer to knowledge in
general or even to all knowledge that can be recalled from memory about a given system,
but, as stated above, to a "precompiled" subunit of information held in memory. Such a
mental model can vary significantly in size and complexity, just as a real system may
vary in size and complexity.*
